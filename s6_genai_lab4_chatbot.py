Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate text,
images, audio, or other data. These models are trained on large datasets and
learn patterns in the data to produce human-like responses. Popular examples
include ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Gemini. Generative AI is widely used in chatbots,
content creation, and code generation.
